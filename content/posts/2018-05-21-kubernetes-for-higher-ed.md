Many people have already written excellent articles explaining why Kubernetes is a good thing. My goal in this
post is to show elaborate on where Kubernetes can drive student and professional project growth and standardization in Higher Ed.
 
First a list of some of the best reasons to consider Kubernetes at your instituion:
 - consistent way to manage production systems (deployment, configs, secrets, tls, logging-stdout/err, monitoring)
 - common application runtime platform (a container)
 - provide a database of all production applications
 - running distributed workloads is less complex
 - don't need a server to run code
 - manage scale out of services 
 - reproducability and backups: all production configs in version control ("gitops")

- Are you a google organization using gsuite?
- Do you integrate 2fa to Google already?
- Do you have a full time sys admin to run Kubernetes on campus?

We want the transformative technology but not the new overhead.
(SEE https://medium.com/google-cloud/google-kubernetes-engine-stop-dealing-with-kubernetes-and-just-use-it-f2b8d73931f1)

- You get a enterprise grade kubernetes cluster with one caommand


Kubernetes is the platform to manage applications in production  

Google Cloud is the platform to manage the technical overhead, business, and orgazational components of Kubernetes

Together these two platforms integrate to create a powerful for developers, operators, and managers:
 - the ability to adopt and utilize a transformative technology
 - the ability to quickly deploy new applications to production
 - the ability to monitor and maintain applications consistently
 - the tools to inspect all production applications
 - the tools to track resource consumption and trace project provenance
